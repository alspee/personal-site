                <p>My name is Allie, and about a year ago I fell in love with learning how to take photos</p>
                
                <p>I had always been curious about photography (going as far as getting a DSLR in 2014), but was intimidated by the learning curve. In 2017 I picked up “Understanding Exposure,” by Bryan Peterson which remained unopened on my bookshelf until the summer of 2024. It was then that I resolved to actually learn how to use my camera — a truly humbling undertaking. </p>
                
                <p>I love framing this practice as “learning how to see,” because composition is… really hard, (and don’t get me started on taste). When I started out I expected to love landscape and street photography, but I’ve really gravitated towards portraits, insects, and animals. Having your photo taken can feel really vulnerable, so it’s always a privilege when I get to show people how <b>I see them.</b> </p>

                <p>I recently changed systems and upgraded my 2014 Canon Rebel t5i, to a Sony alpha. I’ve mainly used prime lenses, and shoot only with a 50mm prime on my Sony. I ran 50, 35, and 24mm prime lenses on my Canon.
